# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built using Python and the `turtle` module. The game allows the player to control the snake, eat food to grow, and avoid colliding with the walls or itself.

## Features

- The player can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys.
- The game resets when the snake collides with itself or the wall.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
2. Save the provided code in a Python file (e.g., `snake_game.py`).
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
